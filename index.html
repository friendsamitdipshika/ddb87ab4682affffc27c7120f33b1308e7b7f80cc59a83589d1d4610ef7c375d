            <h1>A Letter to Dipshika</h1>
            <p>
                Dear Dipshika,

                I hope this letter finds you in great spirits and good health. I’ve been meaning to write to you, to reflect on the memories we’ve shared during our college years. They’ve stayed with me, and I’m sure they hold a special place for you too.

                Do you remember the countless nights we spent on assignments? Your ability to simplify even the most challenging tasks was remarkable. Whether it was a group project or a presentation, you always made sure we got through it together. You were patient, encouraging, and always knew how to keep us on track.

                Then there were the moments when I felt unprepared for events or situations. You always had a way of stepping in to keep things on track and helping me focus. Whether it was a last-minute debate or an unexpected performance, your practical support made all the difference and turned the chaos into something manageable.

                The afternoons at Damodar are some of my fondest memories. We’d sit there for hours, talking about everything and nothing, enjoying the peace and the laughter. And yes, those joints we shared—a bit of mischief that always lightened the mood and brought us closer. Those were moments of pure, carefree joy.

                Failing exams might not seem like something to smile about, but somehow, as a group, we managed to find humor in those moments. Your ability to lighten the mood and keep things in perspective made it easier to move forward together.

                Your leadership during sports events was something I deeply admired. Whether organizing trips or ensuring everyone felt included, you led with energy and enthusiasm. You showed us what it meant to be part of a team and how to find joy in the journey, not just the results.

                Dipshika, your friendship meant so much to me. You were a source of support, laughter, and inspiration. Those years were brighter because of you, and I’m grateful for everything you brought into my life.

                I hope we can reconnect soon and maybe relive some of those memories. Until then, please know that you’re appreciated and remembered fondly.

                Warm regards,

                Amit
